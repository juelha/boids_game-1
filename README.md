- Boid simulation
    - Flock behavior
    - used filter and context spheres for better performance
    - Obstacle and Player interaction
    - Special fish (extra points)
    - researched different ways to optimise the performance further but ran out of time, including but not limited to:
        - using JOBS for multi threaded code (jobified boid behavior in branch: `boids_jobified` are 500 boids with 80 to 100FPS, couldnt include in game due to collision errors),
        - CPU instancing (dealing with materials and texture atlas),
        - Tiling and Cluster algorithms (DBSCAN)
- Sounds (integration of freely usable sound files)
